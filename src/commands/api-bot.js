For each API query you must have the required credentials like API-key. Some might also need some special inputs so make sure that you are familiar with the docs of that particular API. This bot is completely **open source** and we would love your contributions whether it's a new API integration idea or fixing bugs to improve the bot's performance; any kind of help is highly appreciated ;) \n")
