- Invite the bot to your testing server by generating a URL with appropriate scopes and permissions. You have to choose `scopes: bot, applications.commands` and `no bot permissions`. 

- Run `npm run dev` in the terminal for running the bot. Bot will automatically refresh on changes made since this script executes `src/bot.js` file using `nodemon`.
